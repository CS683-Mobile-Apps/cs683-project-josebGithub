# CS683 Project  - MyFoodManager

## Overview 

    Most people waste more food than they think. We waste more than a third of our food
a year, it’s not only waste food, but money as well. Do you know? 1 in 9 Americans are
food insecure. People goes food shopping without knowing that they already have the
foods stocks at their pantry or fridge. Sometimes, they don’t even know the foods
have been in the fridge or pantry are expired and eventually all those foods go to the
trash.
     In order to save food and money and not overbuying, I will build an app called
MyFoodManager that helps people to manage their food for their family, this app can
keep track the inventory of the foods, the expiration date of the foods and the cost of
the foods. It can keep track of what you’ve bought, how much you have spent for
foods, how much you have wasted for food and provides notifications when the food
items are going to expire. Any person hoping to regulate their food buying is a
potential user.
